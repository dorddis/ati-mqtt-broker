Subject: TVS Motors Digital Twin Integration - PoC Complete, Production Access Required

Dear Team,

We have successfully completed the Proof of Concept for integrating TVS Motors' tugger robot fleet with the Twinzo digital twinning platform.

## PoC Status: COMPLETE âœ…
- MQTT data integration from ATI Fleet Manager established
- Twinzo API endpoints identified and validated  
- Mock tugger robot fleet created and configured
- Real-time tracking architecture developed and tested

## Current Blocker
Our Twinzo account has PoC-level permissions, preventing full API access needed for production data sync. This requires account upgrade to production tier.

## Required Next Steps:

**From Twinzo:**
- Upgrade account to production tier with full API access
- Enable billing and provide production authentication tokens

**From TVS Motors:**
- Authorize production ATI Fleet Manager access
- Confirm deployment timeline and operational requirements

**From ATI:**
- Provide production Fleet Manager API credentials
- Supply complete data schema documentation

## Business Impact
Once production-ready: Real-time tugger tracking, operational efficiency monitoring, predictive maintenance, and fleet optimization insights.

The technical integration is complete and ready for immediate deployment once access permissions are resolved.

Recommend scheduling a stakeholder coordination call to finalize production requirements.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
