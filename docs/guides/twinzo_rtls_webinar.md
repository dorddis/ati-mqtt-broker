Welcome and thank you to for joining our webinar on uh RTLS technology and uh the
1:46
smart buyers guide. uh we we have a cheeky subtitle what
1:52
they don't tell you and this is mostly because we are trying to bring vendor
1:57
agnostic view on what the technologies are for indoor location systems how they
2:05
differ uh each of them
2:10
provide to each of them what advantages and disadvantages they have so you can
2:16
make a better decisions one once you are trying to solve your indoor location
2:21
needs. Uh let us wait few more minutes because
2:25
I can still see that people are joining and uh we can start u let's say at 103.
2:35
Uh in the meantime uh please use the Q&A section. It should
2:40
be open uh to ask any questions and at the end I
2:47
will uh try to answer the most of it. Okay. And uh let's let's wait a few more
3:06
minutes for people to join. Okay. So let's start.
4:27
Um and the first section what I'd like to
4:32
talk is a little bit about why we having this uh
4:39
this webinar. So as you may know and or not twinso it's a platform for live
4:46
digital or operational digital twins and one of our major case is uh logistic
4:52
auto uh optimization and automation that is built on RTLS data so realtime
5:00
location system data or services. Uh in this case you can see heat map,
5:06
spaghetti charts and uh a replay of the of the whole shift of a forklift driver
5:12
but we are also able to uh have very deep analytics through web-based
5:18
reporting um not just in a 3D we are able to
5:22
consume data also from the outside system. We are able to operate globally
5:27
uh as all of our customers are global corporations
5:32
and uh once we have the even though the the location and and the analytics of
5:41
the location is very important part of the twins it's just one part as we are
5:46
building what's called an ancially oriented data set where we integrate
5:53
different data streams from different systems everything from SAP to VMS uh
5:59
MEES uh location of machines of people of
6:03
material and we are building this interactive
6:07
view but also building the data set that can
6:12
help then uh towards correlation and causality analytics. We have deployed
6:18
this uh around the glo globe in many many different uh
6:24
uh facilities and cater to a lot of different use cases. So this is one of
6:30
our uh largest customers uh where exactly the correlation and
6:37
causality is the is the main thing how production correlates with uh energy
6:44
consumption correlates with life logistics
6:48
uh gates open and and so on. So how the whole facility acts and operates as an
6:56
organism and what we can do to in real time and also through analytics to make
7:03
it more efficient and uh less uh prone to to consume resources.
7:13
So this is what we do and uh on majority of meetings uh we are being asked how do
7:21
you track people? How do you track polies? How do you track uh material and
7:27
the answer is not uh that simple uh because there are a lot of different
7:32
technologies out there. Each has pros and cons but it's not also that hard
7:38
that our customers can understand it and can't make the decisions. So Twinszo
7:43
itself is is uh vendor and hardware agnostic. So you can use one or multiple
7:50
even in within a single facilities. We are able to consume different 3D models
7:54
from again vendor and model agnostics. of everything from uh custommade models
8:00
to scans to BIM and that also works on the RTLS side.
8:07
So uh the way we are looking and this is
8:11
something how we are approaching uh the how we are approaching the RTL space is
8:20
to look from the edge of infrastructure. So when I talk about the infrastructure
8:29
uh we define two type of infrastructures passive infrastructure that doesn't
8:34
require cables that's the let's say easiest uh way it might require
8:39
batteries like in this case that we see on a video it's a B beacon that is
8:43
placed statically but it's a dumb device it's just a dump device powered by
8:49
electricity or there are technologies that you are able to use QR codes uh and
8:55
so on. So today uh the goal of this of this meeting is to bring to you
9:03
different technologies for different use case so you have a better understanding
9:08
of uh which technology might be best fit for you
9:14
and uh or the use case that you are looking to
9:19
solve. Where are the limitations? uh what are the hidden costs that you
9:24
may not think about and um uh basically to give you the guide how
9:31
to how to think about location indoors. So uh as I said the passive it's either
9:37
dumb devices or can be QR codes or or any other technology that does not
9:43
require active connection and on the other side the active infrastructure
9:49
uh are technologies that does require active power and antenna cables or uh
9:54
active communication with the server side. So uh I like to always um compare
10:01
it to Wi-Fi. So you need to have some infrastructure that is let's say a
10:06
little bit smart that is actually uh tracking and actually
10:10
um gathering the signals. Now when we talk about the passive uh
10:16
infrastructure there are two main uh approaches that uh we have experienced.
10:23
The number one is a BLE approach. So Bluetooth low energy that as in the
10:29
previous slide you could see the placement of PL beacons
10:34
uh that are acting as an anchors and Android devices are placed on forklifts
10:40
and these Android devices are capturing the signals from the B
10:46
beacons and are calculating position through threeeration
10:52
with um so this is one of the let's say with passive infrastructure
10:57
uh you need to have an active device on the mounted that is doing the
11:02
calculation and that is doing the positioning and everything that it's on
11:06
the on the walls it's let's say a dumb device. The second approach that uh is
11:11
now emerging and very very promising is our slum sorry
11:18
our slum technologies. So the slam technology operates either
11:25
using uh vision or lighter and is using uh vision to identify objects and to
11:34
position itself. Uh
11:38
to be able to do that again you need to place a dummy infrastructure which is uh
11:43
which are QR codes uh around the facility and you need to
11:48
wear you need to install um AI uh AI hardware and cameras or
11:56
lighter on the forklift itself. So once you install that and the QR codes you
12:03
will see in this in this uh uh example. So once you do that the
12:10
forklift itself can position uh it can orient itself and provide the
12:16
position to twins or for further visualization and analytic purposes.
12:21
Both of these uh technologies require very little in terms of installation
12:26
efforts. uh there is no cabling involved
12:31
and uh here is a little bit of the comparison. So on the BLA side uh it's
12:39
great for forklifts and and mobile devices. So for instance if you need to
12:43
track uh maintenance workers that have an company issued phone.
12:49
uh the precision usually in reality vary between 3 to 10 m depending on the on
12:55
the environment itself. The infrastructure cost is very low because
13:00
the beacons are are uh fairly cheap. The trackable cost is let's say medium uh
13:06
because you need to buy a tablet and uh of some sort and there are also some
13:13
indirect cost that needs to be done to maintain it especially to uh
13:20
uh replace the battery. So from the experience that we have uh this is very
13:26
this is a great technology for fast PC's. It's very easy to install. Even
13:32
customers can do it themselves. And it's ideal for forklifts, uh, AMRs or
13:38
maintenance. The downsides are that you have to change the batteries now and
13:42
then uh, and works reliably only in the big
13:47
spaces. So when we see you know officer hospital cases this is not that reliable
13:52
technology because the the precision is not there and it actually require and
13:58
one of the biggest downsides that we see is that uh because it the the data are
14:03
transmitted over Wi-Fi and the the active devices are let's say u very
14:09
energy inefficient the
14:14
you need to have a constant connection to to electricity for the trackable
14:19
device. So the tablet needs to be connected to the battery of the forklift
14:23
otherwise it will die after 8 hours. Um so second uh promising technology is uh
14:30
slam. With slam uh what is it's really great for forklifts or HVs AMRs
14:40
uh not so much for anything else. uh but uh you don't need to have any
14:46
infrastructure so you just place those those uh that QR codes and that's it.
14:54
Uh and the in indirect cost are also uh uh let's say rather low or negligible uh
15:01
in terms of uh installation. Uh what is amazing about slam is very
15:07
high accuracy. So you are able to get up to 10 cm and you are able to do to be
15:13
very precise with the location data and it also have potentials uh to use beyond
15:20
tracking. So this is let's say a cutting edge technology. So, but we see also uh
15:25
a rescanning of the facility and other detection of other objects uh
15:32
pedestrians and and different other cases are emerging around slam
15:38
technologies. Thus, uh the only downside so far that
15:42
we are able to say is that the the devices are more expensive than uh
15:48
uh tablets. So, so it's not a not a cheap device, but because of the lack of
15:54
the infrastructure and additionally is very good cost for money and you need to
16:00
have a constant power. So, it needs to be cabled to the to the device. So, it
16:03
needs to be uh pro it needs to be
16:10
constantly under power. So,
16:15
uh now we are able to move towards active infrastructure. So imagine some
16:21
sort of uh network or the networking devices that are actively tracking tags.
16:30
Uh the first that uh I don't have a video for this one but it's very similar
16:36
to the BLE from the passive because it uses the same technology but the
16:40
topology is is def uh it's reversed. So instead of having a smart device mounted
16:47
to a forklift, we have a smart device mounted as a bridges or anchors around
16:52
the facility. So it's the same setup as Wi-Fi hotspots. So you have you have
16:59
active devices that are scanning for those B beacons.
17:04
uh what it's the precision is roughly the same uh as with the passive B
17:10
approach but uh the number of use cases grows. So now you are able to use this
17:18
technology to track pallets to track people to track machines.
17:23
The cost uh is very reasonable. So the the both bridges and trackables are
17:30
within a region uh um uh reasonable costs. The downsides that
17:36
we see is that you need to have uh an infrastructure.
17:40
So you need to be able to um the bridges are usually powered through power over
17:45
Ethernet. So you need to have an Ethernet connection, you need to have a
17:48
server and you need to have um uh it wired together.
17:54
uh there are some special cases where you can go around it with Laura and with
17:57
others. I will talk about that a little bit in the end. But the the major
18:02
downsides we see is that uh especially in in environment industrial environment
18:08
it does require some infrastructure work that might be problematic during the
18:13
full uh production and this is being true for uh all active infrastructure.
18:20
So from our experience the biggest uh the biggest hurdle is that majority
18:27
of industrial customers they work around the clock. So running cables it's only
18:33
possible twice a year. So during summer holiday or uh winter holiday and
18:42
everything in between is it's uh fairly problematic. So uh that's the that's the
18:49
the major major down down term of any active technology. On the other side
18:55
they usually provide much better accuracy and all the use cases that you
18:59
can imagine. So the first major player in the active
19:05
high precision uh
19:09
tracking uh solutions uh is uh BLE angle of arrival. This differs from the BLE
19:16
that we saw because the the BLE uh from be before they calculate through
19:24
searching for at least three anchors and trying to uh triangulate
19:29
uh through calculus. The angle of arrival is uh more advanced uh
19:35
calculation based on the angles of the signal and
19:40
the topology is uh very similar. So you are able to track assets, people, mobile
19:46
devices uh within a facility. You are able you
19:50
are you need to place uh infrastructure that are these dishes and then uh uh th
20:00
those tags are being translated uh uh into position. So what is what is
20:09
very good about the uh angle of arrival technology is that it offers high
20:14
precision usually under one meter sometimes even around half a meter.
20:20
The infrastructure can be leveraged also for
20:24
other things. So you are able to use it as a backbone for IoT
20:30
and uh the cost of trackables is uh still let's say medium price. So it's
20:35
very good for uh let's say medium amount so hundreds
20:40
or thousands of uh trackables that uh uh stay within the facility. So the the
20:48
cost of trackable is still uh significant. So it's not a throwaway
20:52
item and usually but the battery is good for
20:56
years. So uh these are the it's a very good value for money technology. Uh the
21:04
downside is is as same with with any uh active uh
21:12
RTL technologies that you need to run the cable. So retrofit can be uh
21:17
challenging but uh and also for the best performance
21:22
of the position you need to have signal from two anchors. So two dishes needs to
21:26
see the same tag and they are then they are able to provide that high accuracy.
21:32
um there is a flexibility within the technology. So you are able to use for
21:36
instance one dish to cover a larger and a larger site and then you will have
21:41
let's say room accuracy or area accuracy. So, so the topology
21:47
uh can be done in different ways to have different precision uh coverage alongs
21:54
along al along the side that helps with the with precision well with cost
22:00
effectiveness again uh supports all cases. So,
22:06
material people and uh uh forklift tracking or machinery tracking.
22:12
The second very prominent uh technology inside of the high precision uh uh
22:18
spaces is ultra wideband technology. The topology is similar but uh it needs to
22:26
be placed and a at a lower height. So as a B angle of arrival usually is placed
22:32
at the ceiling level. So around 8 m high to have the best uh results from the
22:40
from uh ultra wideband technology. It's good
22:45
to have them uni place on the same plane. So
22:52
again there are there are ways to vary and optimize and we see different
22:57
manufacturers employing different clever approaches to uh solve for instance uh
23:05
the need in between the aisles with less trackers and so on. Uh but generally
23:10
speaking ultra wideband is it's great for very high accuracy.
23:16
So in optimal it can be up to 10 cm that we saw even in the application that we
23:22
did in the video. Um so it's very high accurate.
23:29
The uh infrastructure costs are um roughly the same and uh track trackable
23:36
cost is usually a little bit higher than the BLE.
23:42
uh the cases are uh very flexible. So we have seen everything from
23:50
uh people tracking to uh material to forklift.
23:55
But uh we also saw a very uh very good application in safety especially in uh
24:02
uh when using ultra wideband technology as peer-to-p in peer-to-peer
24:07
communication. uh for instance uh when the when the
24:13
forklift is communicating directly with the uh smart watch or or watch uh on the
24:20
human so it can detecting detect the human behind the corner. So these type
24:26
of approaches can be uh can be done with ultra wideband. It can be done also on
24:32
the local level with B angle of arrival. Uh these type of use cases needs to go
24:37
through the server. So uh it does post some requirements on the infrastructure
24:44
with ultra wideband we see application when it's let's say direct. So it does
24:48
not need to go to the server and the the forklift and and the watches communicate
24:53
uh directly. Um
24:57
uh also what we saw is that if we really want to have this really high accuracy
25:02
uh you need to have a direct line of sight to at least three anchors.
25:07
So uh companies who are really trying to get to this level then the uh
25:13
infrastructure density uh needs to be higher and that has uh you know negative
25:18
uh cost impact. But if uh approached uh with uh with the reason
25:26
uh because you don't need to have the 10 cm accuracy everywhere then uh also the
25:31
deployment can be uh can be very efficient and the downside is the same
25:35
as with any active you need to run cables
25:39
uh through the facility. The
25:50
second to last technology is one that it's uh
25:56
very common. So everybody knows RFID are the tags that you have in a shop to
26:03
prevent stealing. So those are passive RFID tax. Uh there are also uh an active
26:10
RFID tax. And uh I just want to talk about a little bit to to confuse uh to
26:17
avoid the confusion. So even though uh both RFID passive and active
26:24
uh are using these terms for us because uh they both require an active
26:30
infrastructure that actually reads the tax in some sort
26:35
of way and it goes through the server. We consider them as an active
26:39
technologies. Um
26:42
so this video is from the uh RFID that is tracking passive
26:48
uh RFID tax and is using uh seal mounting antennas to
26:59
uh detect uh detects uh around the facility. It can be used
27:06
like this. So it's an over ski ceiling but we saw also application where it uh
27:11
was uh mounted sideways to track the ins and outs from the from the gates.
27:19
uh and uh yeah so the technology itself it's uh
27:26
building on a huge variety of existing passive uh RFID tags that are readily
27:34
available for any other applications. uh with this approach of active RFID
27:44
when the antennas are scanning the the precision can be around 1 m which is
27:49
let's say an amazing uh movement because historically the RFID was only used um
27:58
uh just to get uh a throughput. So I went through the gate
28:04
and uh and uh there was very little more information
28:09
uh with multiple antennas we we would be able to tell if it w if the truck moved
28:14
outside or inside. So it went so which direction he went but that was the end
28:19
of it. Now with this um high precision antennas uh we are able to detect up to
28:26
1 m precision. uh from the cost side of things, this
28:31
approach is uh definitely the most expensive uh from the infrastructure
28:37
point of view. So it requires the higher highest investment. On the other side,
28:42
the trackable cost is the lowest. So uh the uh where we see this uh playing a
28:50
huge role is in uh high volume tracking uh where you need to also have a mix of
28:58
uh where you need to have not only uh imperishable tags that stay with you but
29:05
also you need to support perishable tax. With RFID there are uh printed tax. So
29:11
you can have a label that actually has the RFID embedded that can be coded uh
29:18
when uh printed and then you stick it on the box and then it can leave and it has
29:24
very low cost incense. So uh with high high volume trucking the RFID is
29:31
definitely uh the winner because if you need to t uh track tens of thousand of
29:37
packages that are leaving the premises and will never look back uh the cost of
29:43
trackables for other technology prohibits this use case.
29:49
uh with other technologies you are able to do with scanning. But if you want to
29:54
go uh without the scanning um then the uh the this approach is definitely uh
30:02
worth considering. The the downside is the same. You need
30:06
to have an active uh infrastructure. What is uh good in in that particular
30:13
case with this active RFID is that you only need one gate to get the one m
30:17
precision under the so it doesn't need to have a signal from multiple gates. It
30:22
needs to have just one um overhead uh antenna and if that antenna see
30:30
underneath the the tack it can precisely location it um behind it. Uh that's uh
30:39
uh a big plus if you need to if you need to have only zones with high precision.
30:44
On the other side uh the let's say room precision is it's a little bit harder to
30:51
achieve if you need to go to that uh that route.
30:56
And the last uh uh very common technology that is known
31:01
is GPS. So again GPS it's good to track um
31:07
everything. The downside is that the true GPS has a very low precision. The
31:12
one that you can commercially get stand to 50 C 50 50 m and we see that it's
31:18
jumping. There are specialized technology and specialized hardware that
31:23
uh can get uh better precision outdoors uh but they are usually more costly than
31:31
uh whatever phone you buy. But the infrastructure is free. Uh it's
31:36
available readily available outside and uh unfortunately doesn't work inside.
31:44
uh we saw some let's say trying um approaches where uh fixed GPS uh anchors
31:52
were placed within the facility but uh the precision is not never as great as
31:58
with other active infrastructure and the tags usually are also not on the
32:04
cheap side. So all of those uh technologies have uh
32:16
different variation. So let's say this introduction was mainly to to show you
32:22
what different type of technologies are available
32:27
uh are already established on the market and reliable
32:32
uh comparison between each other and uh uh show a little bit of more use
32:39
cases that uh you can compare better. uh there are special cases and variations
32:45
that uh work for different uh industries.
32:50
So uh for instance as I mentioned there are there are active RFID with battery
32:56
powered RFID tax that provides uh a better
33:03
uh readability over large distances can achieve high precision and u optimize
33:10
the cost but they because they are they are battery powered they are losing this
33:14
let's say cheap uh perishable uh tag uh advantage age. Uh also forklift
33:23
mounted RFID readers. So you use forklift to actually read the material
33:28
and then then or a person with a scanner can read the material and then use the
33:34
scanner or the forklift to locate itself. That can decrease the cost of
33:38
the infrastructure itself because then you don't need to cover with the high
33:42
precision technology for RFID. the whole you you just you you do the gates you do
33:47
the parts of it and then the rest uh you calculate through other means
33:52
uh also uh Laura based communication is on the uprise so uh Laura is it's a low
34:00
energy communication method and uh together with localization with
34:06
BL GPS and other localization technologies it can provide uh tools to
34:13
uh have a battery powered. The downside of Laura base is that the the up uh
34:20
update rate it's uh 30 seconds is the fastest. I think that uh only once in 30
34:28
seconds it can't u uh transmit the the localization. So the ideal way for this
34:35
is search and find. So you don't have to have the localization always or you just
34:40
need to localizate once in 10 minutes. for these type of uh cases Laura based
34:47
uh RTLS with either BLE or GPS uh can be uh very very interesting
34:56
uh especially for instance if you mix outside and uh inside and outside and
35:01
the last thing uh that I have in this let's say special cases is private 5G
35:06
networks so in theory the 5G uh with the latest update
35:13
uh is supposed to be able to local localize the the 5G device within uh 1
35:21
meter. So far uh we have not seen this uh being yet adopted in a large scale or
35:30
in any let's say uh industrial setting especially uh within our client base.
35:36
uh it is a very promising to see but uh so far uh we saw only let's say academia
35:43
campuses that had that working but the adoption by industrial sector is uh uh
35:50
slow I think the main and this is just my fabulation I think the main reason at
35:54
the at the uh at the moment is because those company heavily invested into
36:01
Wi-Fi technology for connectivity and the biggest uh Plus for 5G network is
36:08
not location that's let's say a byproduct but it's actually the the data
36:13
high speeded data communication that can replace Wi-Fi but as the company is
36:19
already invested heavily in the Wi-Fi over the last decades I think they are
36:24
reluctant to switch to 5G networks right now but I think this is a technology
36:30
that will uh play uh some part in the future as the
36:38
um as it as as the Wi-Fi will become let's say obsolete or they will start to
36:44
renew their infrastructure and the last last thing before the Q&A
36:55
uh is talk about the benefits. So one of our major cases in twins uh is
37:03
leveraging the specially oriented data set to
37:09
uh analyze uh RTLS data in context and to provide
37:16
uh actionable insights into how to optimize the facility plus use the IoT
37:24
signals that we get from other systems to to drive the logistic performance to
37:30
create work orders and to basically create an Uber for intra logistics
37:34
within a 3D space. Uh these are some examples that we have.
37:41
So how much the investments can be and uh what what savings over the
37:49
uh over the period uh customers can have. So on average our customers are
37:56
are saving around 20% of logistic fleet or not having hire not having to hire
38:02
because in Europe it's the situation is changing that uh it's no longer just the
38:08
cost cutting game is that if somebody left uh we have a problem uh to replace
38:14
him. So companies are looking into how to produce and deliver and and function
38:20
with less staff. So uh in ma in majority cases the 20%
38:27
efficiency gain is uh uh a good target the the top we had was 40%.
38:37
So there is a room even to be to be better now with the with the race of
38:43
AGVs and AMRs and maybe that would be also a question to the audience if they
38:48
have an experience with that. So with the race of AGVs and AMRs uh we are
38:55
getting a new requirements uh for location technologies to track AGVs and
38:59
AMRs because they usually get stuck somewhere and it's a very common problem
39:05
in an industry that the AGV or AMR uh stops due to safety zones because
39:13
somebody puts pallet somewhere or is not able to make a turn because there is
39:17
another forklift there. and the material is not delivered on
39:23
time. So I'm sorry. So now now more and more companies are
39:32
coming to us to solve the tracking of the AGVs and AMRs. With some
39:37
manufacturers, we are able to get the position directly from the device with
39:41
from others. It's easier to have an RTLS u infrastructure installed.
39:48
uh so they are able to get the the data and then they are able to actually
39:52
monitor uh in this hybrid environments uh what's
39:58
the uh what's the reason? Yeah. So why we
40:03
why we are getting stuck where we are getting stuck what we can do and if we
40:08
do any corrective action uh did it um uh did it have the impact that we
40:16
desired. So, um this is the the introduction to to RTLS
40:27
technologies. Uh let's open a Q&A uh to see if we have
40:32
any questions. So, uh where we have a Q&A,
40:41
not here, not here. And we do have 11 questions.
40:52
So uh that's the first question. Does Twinso provides RTS solution or it is
40:56
just a general session on the problem? Now so as as you saw this was not just a
41:03
general session. It was to bring a real life examples of application of
41:09
different technology. Twinso does not provide its own RTLS technology. uh we
41:15
we worked with many vendors around the globe to uh be a part of the of the uh
41:23
solution in the end and to provide a software on top of the any RTLS. So we
41:29
are RTLS agnostic. Therefore we do have experience with with all of the
41:34
technologies that that uh I mentioned. So, and the goal of this meet this uh
41:40
presentation was to bring this knowledge to you so you can get a a better
41:46
understanding of what you need uh what could be the challenges and how to look
41:52
uh uh for a for a RTLS solution. Of course,
41:56
we are able to help with majority of customers. We are helping to to build
42:02
the budgets. We are helping to choose the technologies. We are doing this
42:06
introduction. We are also introducing different vendors to them. So they are
42:10
able to to choose who who to purchase the the solution the hardware itself or
42:16
the infrastructure itself. You are not sharing.
42:24
Oh okay. So there was a why it did didn't share.
42:44
So yes, I did show the presentation and apparently the sharing didn't work. So
42:49
let me open it again. And uh
43:03
where is the Okay.
43:20
So yes, I did share a whole presentation with everything and you didn't see it.
43:25
So that's my bad. And because of the how this works, I didn't see questions until
43:30
now and I'm very sorry about that. So uh I
43:37
hope that you uh got something from my from my uh explanation. We'll see if
43:43
somebody is here. That's the zoom thing.
44:15
Yes. So I will go to the tech comparison site and then we will share the
44:19
presentation afterwards. So we can go again. So I had a lot of videos
44:26
and I'll show you the the uh tech comparison side.
44:36
So um again I'm very sorry uh for the for the lag of presentation.
44:43
I will be doing the same same uh presentation again hopefully with the
44:49
sharing uh in few weeks for the other time zone. So uh please you can also
44:57
register and then you will see you will receive a video out of it. So as I said
45:02
from the infrastructure point of view we are
45:07
uh describing or we we are looking from the passive and active point of view. So
45:13
we have a BLE and this is the this is the comparison. So the B
45:19
uh I hope that I'm sharing right now because this
45:23
does it does it share? I don't know. I must say I hate Zoom and
45:32
I never use it. Um
45:38
okay. So uh yeah and this is the let's say a comparison comparison table that
45:43
we have uh that I have been talking for the last 40 minutes about
45:48
and uh so again to recap so the B in passive
45:54
infrastructure you place the beacons around the facility and use a smart
45:58
device to calculate the position the precision is around the 3 to 10 m
46:03
infrastructure cost is very low trackable cost is uh let's say medium to
46:09
high and there are some indirect cost because you need to replace the battery.
46:13
slam technologies. They use vision to they use vision to
46:22
uh locate the the forklifts of the AMR. The POS the precision is very very high.
46:28
So it's really good. The infrastructure cost is negligible because it's just the
46:32
QR codes. The trackable is it's on the high end. Uh but because of the lack of
46:38
infrastructure and negligible and cost is very good for uh value for money. The
46:45
downside of the boats is that they do for a continuous operation. They do need
46:49
a power source on the forklift. So they are good for the machinery not not great
46:55
for for people tracking on the active uh infrastructure RFID technology. all uh
47:02
cases are covered and u again the BL RS size is is uh more cost effective but
47:11
the the position precision is to 3 to 10 m so it's not that precise and you need
47:16
to run the uh power of the BOE and cables and anchors so that's the usually
47:22
that's the biggest biggest issue with B angle of arrival you have under one m
47:29
uh precision and uh uh there is also a trackable uh
47:35
cost that it's uh uh fairly let's say uh medium or uh medium trackable costs with
47:44
ultra wideband as mentioned you can get up to 10 cm
47:48
the infrastructure cost is is um roughly the same so they they compete with each
47:56
other the trackable cost is a little bit higher
48:00
uh but it has a it has all these other advantages in terms of uh uh safety
48:05
cases if they are needed. Uh with RFID as I mentioned uh the active RFID or or
48:14
the active infrastructure with RFID can have two approaches active tax or
48:19
passive tax. Uh with passive with both you are able to get around 1 m precision
48:24
but the cost of infrastructure is the highest from from the technologies we
48:28
saw. The truckables is um the truckables are very very cheap
48:35
and uh yes. So
48:41
um let me open questions if I if I have any questions.
48:56
Okay. So there is uh so thank you very much and I'll try to I will share the
49:02
deck with you afterwards. So I will share the deck so you can uh uh you can
49:07
you can saw it. I'm very sorry that uh there was this technical issue. It was a
49:13
problem between the keyboard and the chair. So uh uh the next webinar
49:18
hopefully will be better. And uh so now for the let's say the questions that uh
49:25
uh are here. of the first 5G versus Wi-Fi was which is which common medium
49:30
is better. Um
49:35
I don't think that uh uh that's uh
49:41
so every every between 5G Wi-Fi and Laura uh every has its advantages and
49:47
disadvantages. So for instance Wi-Fi is very common. So
49:51
everywhere you you come now the Wi-Fi is there. Now the coverage it's not always
49:57
that great. But the biggest downside of the Wi-Fi is it's very costly
50:02
communication. So all Wi-Fi communication devices are
50:08
uh very energy inefficient. And by energy inefficient I mean that they the
50:14
battery will never last uh months, weeks, uh years. So so that's the
50:20
biggest downside. If that's the pro prohibitive factor, you need to look
50:24
elsewhere. With LoRa, you are able to solve this because the LoRa is very
50:29
energy efficient and those devices that communicate over Laura can last on
50:33
batteries for months or even years. But the cost of it is the frequency. So you
50:39
get the update only once in a while or on demand.
50:44
Uh or for instance there are TS that have accelerometer and are sending only
50:49
when they have moved. So through this type of u energy consump uh conserving
50:55
measures you can get a better um IoT communication and the lora itself the
51:03
the protocol is very efficient in terms of uh uh packages so it's a low energy
51:10
consumption so this has its place in this type of uh infrastructures and in
51:16
5G as mentioned uh me personally I have ne I have not seen one implementation of
51:23
5G in an industrial sector. So in theory it's it's very promising technology but
51:31
in reality I have no idea how the battery would work. What is the cost of
51:36
the implementation uh return? What are the the benefits
51:41
except of speed and this type of uh application. So for the pi private 5G I
51:46
hope that this did answer the answer the question.
51:54
Now the second uh question that I see here
51:58
is what is the obstacle through using RFID? My client has scanning obstacle to
52:04
use the scanner to scan the container box while it has been
52:11
here to apply in our co cooperation. Do you have any suggestion to sex
52:20
for a common situation? So the
52:27
I'm not sure if I if I understand the question correctly
52:32
that has a scanning obstacle. I don't know what's the scanning obs to to scan
52:38
the container box. So the biggest obstacle usually with RFID are let's say
52:43
a metal u is metal. So from what we saw with RFID it's very
52:51
important to understand what type of uh where we are placing the RFID tax.
52:56
Sometimes we need to place multiple tags on a s uh single box and how much metal
53:03
is within the within the tracked uh solution. And then the question is do we
53:09
track the so there are three approaches how to with RFID. So you can have an
53:15
have an handheld scanners and then you need to have a process. So people will
53:19
go and scan it uh sometimes over longer distances but
53:24
it can it's let's say similar than than visual scanning.
53:30
The second approach is to have and uh gates. So you go through the gate
53:37
from production to warehouse and this transition is being registered for that
53:44
there are there are existing solution that can do this very rel reliable but
53:48
usually you place multiple antennas around the gates. So you are able to
53:52
scan the the box from uh from all sides. And then the last thing uh is that you
53:59
can have this overhead uh let me jump to the overhead
54:06
this one. So you can have an overhead antennas that are actually scanning the
54:12
uh the facility they are placed and as you go the different antenna register it
54:17
position it and gives you the precise information. This is also uh possible
54:24
uh but as mentioned and is in the in the in the table uh it was uh it's the the
54:32
most expensive uh antennas available. Now uh if you have perishables that go
54:39
outside or if you are tracking inside of the boxes. So for instance this is a
54:44
very good example. So you have the uh so uh
54:53
yeah the pause is how
55:02
resumed. Okay now it's resumed. So the uh for instance, if you have uh
55:10
cardboard boxes with with items inside, it's also possible to have every item
55:16
labeled. So you have I don't know dozens of hundreds of of items inside and you
55:21
are able to track them all. There is a bit of interference that might happen.
55:26
We saw that in this implementation and um
55:35
um so that needs to be wary and it it might
55:39
not be 100% accurate. Now we have another what about camera and QR or
55:46
something if they placed close like 2 m but they are cheaper and almost same
55:51
level of accuracy. Now with uh with camera I have the video. So
56:00
So these are called slam technologies. This one where you mount the cameras on
56:08
a forklift and it identify itself the
56:15
uh through the vision. I hope that uh I'm sharing and it's
56:23
working. Um uh and are able to achieve up to
56:32
up to 10 cm accuracy. And uh here you are setting up the
56:41
you are setting setting up the the units on the forklifts that has cameras and
56:49
then you place QR codes on the on the pillars and then you are able to
56:54
position yourself. When we talk about the QR codes on the material
57:00
that is possible but uh again it has it has its its uh
57:06
own approaches or own uh uh
57:12
specifics. So for instance you need to you need to have a combination with some
57:18
other type of RTLS. So for instance, if you want to track a pallet, you need to
57:22
have a QR code attached to the pallet that it's readable for from a long
57:27
distance. So it needs to have certain or longer distance. So it need to have the
57:31
certain size and then you need to have an RF uh the RTLS enabled devices that
57:37
it's scanning that can be done through the uh handheld scanner. So, so in
57:43
combination for instance with B active infrastructure, you can have an handheld
57:48
scanner that scans the scans the uh the material and the location of the
57:54
handheld scanner is attached to the material. But now if you move the
57:59
material without scanning it, you don't know where the material is. Uh the
58:05
second approach is that you have you can have a camera on the forklift that is
58:09
actually uh reading the QR on the uh
58:15
on the pallet. But again you need to have an R RTLS technology on the
58:21
forklift so you are able to attach the position of the forklift to the position
58:25
of the uh to the position of the uh uh of the pallet. So there are these let's
58:32
say special cases that uh can be done but they do have challenges and are not
58:39
uh let's say universal for everyone. So what we saw in the RTLS space is that
58:45
there is not a single technology that solve every need in every environment.
58:51
So every environment is little bit different and some technologies work
58:54
better. uh we have customers that have a huge
58:58
variety of of uh in production and then we have customers that have
59:05
only standardized pallets and that's it and uh different solution can be uh sold
59:11
for different uh customers. So let me check if there is any
59:18
can you go to that tech comparison side. I will send the I will send the uh
59:30
presentation to all the uh participants. Okay. And uh this is the last question.
59:43
So if there are any other questions, let's let's wait if somebody asks
59:47
something and if not then thank you very much. Sorry again for uh uh the the
59:55
problem with the with the sharing. Uh I will make sure that it will not happen
59:59
again. Uh I will be doing this presentation for the other for the for
1:00:05
different time zones. So feel free to register also to that to get the better
1:00:09
recording and uh I will share the presentation the
1:00:14
PowerPoint uh to
1:00:18
uh after the after the meeting to all the participants.
1:00:27
So uh thank you. Uh I hope that uh if you have any
1:00:34
further questions feel free to reach to me. If you need to determine what
1:00:39
technology might be best for you, if you need to help with calculate the ROI or
1:00:43
budgetary costs or if you have any other RTLS related questions, we are here to
1:00:49
help and uh we'll try to uh point you in the right direction and help you with uh
1:00:55
with the whole optimization project. So, thank you very much. Uh, have a
1:01:02
great day and, uh, the materials will come in the next day or two. Bye-bye.
