Subject: ATI IP Whitelisting Done - Next Steps: Coordinate Mapping

Hi Patrik,

Good news - we've sent your IP to ATI for whitelisting. You should be able to subscribe to topics soon.

Once connected, here are the coordinate transformation parameters for Old Plant:

ATI coordinates (meters) -> Twinzo coordinates (millimeters)

Affine Transform:
  X_twinzo = 999.738230 * X_ati + 22.879501 * Y_ati + 95598.77
  Y_twinzo = 22.879501 * X_ati + (-999.738230) * Y_ati + 167357.60

Parameters:
  AFFINE_A = 999.738230
  AFFINE_B = 22.879501
  AFFINE_C = 22.879501
  AFFINE_D = -999.738230  (negative = Y-axis flip)
  AFFINE_TX = 95598.77
  AFFINE_TY = 167357.60

Key notes:
- Scale: 1000:1 (meters to millimeters)
- Rotation: 1.31 degrees clockwise
- Y-axis is flipped between ATI and Twinzo
- Target sector: Old Plant (Sector 2)

Device mapping (ATI name -> Twinzo device):
- tug-55-tvsmotor-hosur-09 -> tug-55-hosur-09
- tug-39-tvsmotor-hosur-07 -> tug-39-hosur-07
- tug-133 -> tug-133

Let me know once the IP is whitelisted and if you need any clarification.

Best regards
