Subject: ATI MQTT Subscription Fix - Client ID Must Match Username

Hi Patrik,

I've identified the subscription issue. The ATI broker requires these exact settings:

CRITICAL SETTINGS:
- Host: tvs-dev.ifactory.ai:8883
- Username: tvs-audit-user
- Password: TVSAudit@2025
- Client ID: tvs-audit-user  (MUST match username exactly!)
- Protocol: MQTT v5 (not v3.1.1)
- Clean Session: true

TOPICS:
- ati_fm/#
- fleet/trips/info

The main issue is usually the Client ID not matching the username. Both must be "tvs-audit-user".

I've created test scripts that work perfectly:
- test_patrik_connection.js (Node.js)
- test_patrik_connection.py (Python)
- PATRIK_MQTT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md (full guide)

Run either test script to verify connection. Both are confirmed working and receiving live data from all AMRs.

Let me know if you need any clarification!

Best regards
