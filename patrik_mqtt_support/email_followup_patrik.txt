Subject: RE: MQTT Subscription - ACL Permission Error (Code 135)

Hi Patrik,

Thanks for the screenshots. The error is Code 135 (Not Authorized) - an ACL permissions issue.

IMMEDIATE FIX TO TRY:

In your MQTTX Certificate setting, change from:
❌ "CA signed server certificate"
✅ "CA or Self signed certificates"

This mismatch with SSL Secure disabled might be causing the ACL rejection.

ALTERNATIVE - RUN MY TEST SCRIPTS:

My scripts work perfectly and receive live data. Can you test them?

Node.js: node test_patrik_connection.js
Python: python test_patrik_connection.py

If they work for you, it's an MQTTX configuration issue. If they don't work, we have a deeper ACL problem on the broker.

If the certificate change doesn't fix it, let's schedule a quick call to debug together.

Best regards
