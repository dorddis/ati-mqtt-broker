Subject: ATI Connection Fix - Change QoS to 1

Hi Patrik,

Update from ATI team - no IP whitelisting needed after all.

They checked their logs and found the issue:

PROBLEM: You're using QoS=0
SOLUTION: Change to QoS=1 for both connection and subscription

In your subscription settings:
- QoS: 1 (At least once) - NOT 0

This should fix the 'Not Authorized' error.

Let me know if it works!

Best regards
