# Factory Layouts

This directory contains 3D factory floor layouts for coordinate mapping and visualization.

## Files

### Plant4_Layout.fbx
- **Facility**: TVS Plant 4
- **Format**: FBX (Autodesk Filmbox)
- **Size**: 2.8 MB
- **Purpose**: 3D layout for AMR tracking visualization on Twinzo platform
- **Contents**: Factory floor with marked paths, warehouse areas, and AMR movement zones

## Twinzo Configuration

**Current Setup:**
- Client: TVSMotor
- Branch: AMR Tracking
- Devices: tugger-01, tugger-02, tugger-03, tugger-04
- Areas: Test-area-1, Warehouse 1
- Beacons: beacon-01

## Coordinate System Notes

Based on Twinzo 3D visualization, the factory layout shows:
- Marked pathways (yellow lines on floor)
- Multiple zones/areas for AMR operation
- Need to determine coordinate bounds from actual AMR position data
